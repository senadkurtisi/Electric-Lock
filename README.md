# Electric-Lock #

### Code Composer Studio project. ###

The programs is intended for simulating an electric lock functionality.
In order to unlock the lock we need to input the right 4-digit password.
The password is predefined in the program, and along with that
it cannot be changed. The program starts with the first digit selected
on the LCD. Using potentiometer we can change the value of the first
digit, and confirm our selection using the first button on the left.
The process is similar for remaining three digits. Finally we submit
our selection for the fourth digit we get a feedback which indicates
if we got the password right. First LED indicates success while the
other indicates failure. Both LEDs are on for three seconds.

*The project was tested on the board that was created in the 
School of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade
by the staff of the Electronics department.*
